<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he
 left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN)
 (Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire) in October, 1994.
 It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory
  for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the European Commission
   and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
    which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.[3]

The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry
 members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C.
 Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors,
 causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed.
 The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of
 core principles and components which are chosen by the consortium.
